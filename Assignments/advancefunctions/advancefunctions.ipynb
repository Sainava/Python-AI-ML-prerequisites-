    "You're correct that when you're printing just the `nth` term of the Fibonacci sequence (not all of them), it may seem like memoization wouldn't be useful because only one term is being calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, let's break it down to understand why memoization is still beneficial:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fibonacci Calculation Without Memoization:\n",
    "In the original code without memoization, if you want to calculate `fibonacci(5)`, the function calls would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `fibonacci(5)` calls `fibonacci(4)` and `fibonacci(3)`\n",
    "- `fibonacci(4)` calls `fibonacci(3)` and `fibonacci(2)`\n",
    "- `fibonacci(3)` calls `fibonacci(2)` and `fibonacci(1)`\n",
    "- `fibonacci(2)` calls `fibonacci(1)` and `fibonacci(0)`\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, `fibonacci(3)`, `fibonacci(2)`, `fibonacci(1)`, and `fibonacci(0)` are recalculated multiple times. This creates redundant work and makes the algorithm inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fibonacci Calculation With Memoization:\n",
    "With memoization, the first time you calculate `fibonacci(3)`, the result is cached. So when `fibonacci(3)` is called again (as part of calculating `fibonacci(4)`), it doesn't need to recompute the value. It can simply look it up in the cache, making the process faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Is Memoization Useful Even If You're Only Calculating One Term?\n",
    "If you are calculating just one term, say `fibonacci(n)`, memoization might not seem that useful for small values of `n`. However, if your program is running in a context where the Fibonacci function is called multiple times (e.g., if you have a larger program where Fibonacci calculations are needed repeatedly), memoization ensures that redundant calculations are avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- **In recursive calls:** If you're calling the Fibonacci function multiple times within other recursive calls (e.g., you need the first `n` Fibonacci numbers in another function or loop), memoization helps avoid recalculating the same values.\n",
    "- **In larger programs:** Even if you're only printing a single term for now, if you plan to extend the program to compute multiple terms (like in a loop or another calculation), memoization will significantly speed up the overall execution by preventing redundant calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In Your Example:\n",
    "If you're calculating and printing all Fibonacci numbers up to `n`, memoization will prevent recalculating the same Fibonacci numbers for each iteration in the loop. Here's the potential scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "For `n = 5`, without memoization:\n",
    "- `fibonacci(5)` is called, which calls `fibonacci(4)` and `fibonacci(3)`.\n",
    "- `fibonacci(4)` is called, which calls `fibonacci(3)` and `fibonacci(2)`.\n",
    "- `fibonacci(3)` is called, which calls `fibonacci(2)` and `fibonacci(1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, many of these calls overlap, causing unnecessary recomputations. With memoization, once `fibonacci(3)` is calculated, it will be cached and reused.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "While memoization might seem unnecessary when you're printing just one value, it becomes crucial when you're calling the function repeatedly, even within a loop or for multiple Fibonacci numbers, or when the Fibonacci sequence becomes larger. It helps reduce the time complexity from exponential to linear for recursive Fibonacci calculations."

    "### Explanation of Memoization in Python:\n",
    "Memoization is an optimization technique used to make functions more efficient by storing (caching) the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again. In Python, this can be done using a dictionary or built-in tools like functools.lru_cache.\n",

    "In your current Fibonacci function, the same values are being recalculated multiple times, leading to inefficient performance. Memoization can improve this by storing previously computed values.\n",

    "You can use functools.lru_cache, which automatically caches function results."

    "A **decorator** in Python is a design pattern that allows you to modify or enhance the behavior of a function or method without changing its actual code. It’s essentially a function that takes another function as an argument, modifies its behavior, and then returns a new function with the enhanced functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Decorators Work:\n",
    "A decorator is applied to a function using the `@decorator_name` syntax, just above the function definition. When you call the decorated function, Python will first apply the decorator function, which can wrap or alter the original function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Example of a Decorator:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def decorator_function(original_function):\n",
    "    def wrapper_function():\n",
    "        print(\"Function is about to run\")\n",
    "        original_function()  # Call the original function\n",
    "        print(\"Function has finished running\")\n",
    "    return wrapper_function\n",
    "\n",
    "@decorator_function\n",
    "def say_hello():\n",
    "    print(\"Hello!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# When you call say_hello, it's actually calling the wrapper function\n",
    "say_hello()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Function is about to run\n",
    "Hello!\n",
    "Function has finished running\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "1. `decorator_function` is a decorator that takes `original_function` (in this case, `say_hello`) and defines a `wrapper_function` around it.\n",
    "2. The `wrapper_function` prints a message before and after calling the original function (`say_hello`).\n",
    "3. By using `@decorator_function`, we apply this behavior to `say_hello` without modifying its code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- **Without a decorator**: You would have to manually modify `say_hello` every time you want to add extra behavior.\n",
    "- **With a decorator**: You can add pre/post actions around any function easily by just adding `@decorator_name` above the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decorators in Action:\n",
    "- **Logging**: You can use decorators to log when a function is called.\n",
    "- **Authorization**: Check if a user is authorized to call a function before running it.\n",
    "- **Memoization**: As we saw in the Fibonacci example, `@lru_cache` is a decorator that caches function results to improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Built-in Decorators:\n",
    "Python provides several built-in decorators like:\n",
    "- `@staticmethod`: Defines a method that does not require access to an instance.\n",
    "- `@classmethod`: Defines a method that takes a class as the first argument.\n",
    "- `@property`: Used to define a method as a property.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decorators are a powerful feature in Python and can be used to keep code modular, clean, and reusable."

    "    return memo[n]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How it works**: The `fib` function explicitly accepts a `memo` dictionary as an argument. This dictionary is used to store previously computed Fibonacci values. It starts with an empty dictionary (`memo={}`), and as the function recurses, it stores results for each `n` in the `memo` dictionary.\n",
    "- **Caching**: The memoization happens manually inside the function by checking if the value of `n` is already in the `memo` dictionary. If it's found, the function returns the cached result. Otherwise, it computes the Fibonacci value and stores it in the `memo` dictionary.\n",
    "- **Behavior**: Since `memo` is passed as an argument, it persists across recursive calls. If you want to start with a fresh dictionary for each call, you would need to pass a new empty dictionary each time.\n",

    "### Key Differences in Memoization:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Automatic vs. Manual Memoization**:\n",
    "   - **`@lru_cache`**: Memoization is automatic. You don't need to pass or manage the cache yourself. The cache is handled internally.\n",
    "   - **`fib` with `memo={}`**: Memoization is manual. You need to explicitly handle the cache by passing the `memo` dictionary to each recursive call.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scope of Caching**:\n",
    "   - **`@lru_cache`**: The cache is global to the function, and it retains its state between function calls. Once a value is cached, it will be available for all future calls to the `fibonacci` function.\n",
    "   - **`fib` with `memo={}`**: The cache is specific to each call because the `memo` dictionary is passed around. The cache is not shared between different calls unless you explicitly pass the same dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Will `fibonacci(15)` Use Values from `fibonacci(10)`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, when you call `fibonacci(15)`, it **can use the values obtained in `fibonacci(10)`** due to caching. Here’s how:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you call `fibonacci(10)`, it will compute the values for `fibonacci(9)`, `fibonacci(8)`, and so on, until it reaches the base cases `fibonacci(1)` and `fibonacci(0)`.\n",
    "- These computed values are stored in the cache (due to `@lru_cache`).\n",
    "- When you call `fibonacci(15)`, it will first compute the result for `fibonacci(14)`, which requires `fibonacci(13)`, and so on. But, since `fibonacci(10)` and its intermediate values are already cached, the function will reuse those cached values instead of recalculating them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature                   | `@lru_cache`                    | `fib` with explicit `memo`     |\n",

    "### Detailed Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calling `fib(10)`**:\n",
    "   - When you call `fib(10)`, the function recursively computes the Fibonacci values for `fib(9)`, `fib(8)`, and so on, down to the base cases `fib(1)` and `fib(0)`.\n",

    "   \n",
    "2. **Memoization**:\n",
    "   - After calculating `fib(10)`, the function will have stored all the intermediate Fibonacci values (like `fib(9)`, `fib(8)`, etc.) in the `memo` dictionary. These values will be cached and reused when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calling `fib(15)`**:\n",
    "   - When you call `fib(15)`, the function needs to compute `fib(14)` and `fib(13)`, and so on. During this calculation, it will use the previously computed values stored in the `memo` dictionary for `fib(10)` and any other values that were already computed.\n",
    "   - So, for example:\n",
    "     - The call to `fib(14)` will use `fib(13)` and `fib(12)`.\n",
    "     - While calculating `fib(13)`, it will use `fib(10)`, `fib(9)`, and so on, if they are already cached.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In Summary:\n",
    "- **Yes, `fib(15)` will use the values obtained from `fib(10)`** because they are stored in the `memo` dictionary. Since `fib(10)` was computed and cached, the function will look up the value in the dictionary rather than recomputing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple demonstration of how the memoization works with this approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fib(n, memo={}):\n",
    "    '''calculates the nth term of the fibonacci series'''\n",
    "    if n in memo:\n",
    "        return memo[n]\n",
    "    if n <= 1:\n",
    "        return n\n",
    "    memo[n] = fib(n-1, memo) + fib(n-2, memo)\n",

    "# Calling fib(15) will reuse the values stored for fib(10)\n",
    "print(fib(15))  # Output: 610\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when `fib(15)` is called, it will leverage the results from the `memo` dictionary, which already contains values like `fib(10)`. This makes the process faster than recalculating those intermediate Fibonacci values from scratch."

    "The `memo` dictionary has a special property because it's defined as a **default mutable argument**.

    "2. **Calling `fib(15)`**:\n",
    "   - When you call `fib(15)`, it needs to compute `fib(14)` and `fib(13)`, and so on.\n",
    "   - While doing this, it will **reuse the values stored in `memo`** for `fib(10)` and any intermediate values that were previously computed (since they are cached from the first call).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fib(n, memo={}):\n",
    "    '''calculates the nth term of the fibonacci series'''\n",
    "    if n in memo:\n",
    "        return memo[n]\n",
    "    if n <= 1:\n",
    "        return n\n",
    "    memo[n] = fib(n-1, memo) + fib(n-2, memo)\n",

    "# Calling fib(15) will reuse the values stored for fib(10) in memo\n",
    "print(fib(15))  # Output: 610\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Point:\n",
    "- **The `memo` dictionary is shared** across all calls to `fib` because it is a default argument.\n",
    "- **Values from `fib(10)` will be reused in `fib(15)`** without recomputing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Happens Internally:\n",
    "- When you call `fib(10)`, the function computes `fib(9)`, `fib(8)`, ..., and stores the results in `memo`.\n",
    "- When you call `fib(15)`, the function checks the `memo` dictionary and finds that `fib(10)` has already been computed, so it directly returns `memo[10]` instead of recalculating it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Works:\n",
    "- The `memo` dictionary isn't local to a single call of the `fib` function. It is shared across recursive calls and between separate calls to `fib(10)` and `fib(15)` because it's a **default argument**.\n",
    "  \n",
    "So, **you're not wrong in thinking that the `memo` dictionary persists across calls**, and because of this, `fib(15)` can use the cached value of `fib(10)` even though `fib(10)` was calculated earlier in the program."

    "Yes, exactly! The behavior you're describing applies specifically to **mutable default arguments** like dictionaries, lists, or sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, default arguments are evaluated **once** when the function is defined, not each time the function is called. This means that if a mutable object (like a dictionary) is used as a default argument, it will be shared across all function calls, and any changes made to it will persist across those calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it Works with `memo={}`:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you define the `memo` argument as a default dictionary in your `fib` function (`memo={}`), Python initializes it once when the function is defined. From that point onward, the same `memo` dictionary is used in every call to the `fib` function unless you explicitly pass a new dictionary. Therefore, when you call `fib(10)` and `fib(15)`, they both use the **same `memo` dictionary**, and the results from one call are available to the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mutable vs Immutable Default Arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mutable Default Arguments**: If you use a mutable object like a dictionary (`memo={}`), the object persists across function calls. This is what happens in your example.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Immutable Default Arguments**: If you use an immutable object (like `None`, an integer, a string, or a tuple), Python creates a new object each time the function is called, meaning the default value doesn't persist across calls. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  def example(n, default=None):\n",
    "      if default is None:\n",
    "          default = []\n",
    "      default.append(n)\n",
    "      return default\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  In this case, since `default` is `None` by default, a new list is created each time the function is called. This avoids the issue with mutable default arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Mutable vs Immutable Default Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mutable Argument Example** (`memo={}`):\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def fib(n, memo={}):\n",
    "       if n in memo:\n",
    "           return memo[n]\n",
    "       if n <= 1:\n",
    "           return n\n",
    "       memo[n] = fib(n-1, memo) + fib(n-2, memo)\n",
    "       return memo[n]\n",
    "\n",
    "   # First call stores results in the same `memo` dictionary.\n",
    "   print(fib(10))  # Output: 55\n",
    "   # Second call reuses the `memo` dictionary with previously computed results.\n",
    "   print(fib(15))  # Output: 610\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `memo` dictionary is **shared** across all calls to `fib`, and the values are cached across function calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Immutable Argument Example** (`default=None`):\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def example(n, default=None):\n",
    "       if default is None:\n",
    "           default = []  # Creates a new list each time the function is called\n",
    "       default.append(n)\n",
    "       return default\n",
    "\n",

    "   print(example(1))  # Output: [1]\n",

    "   - Here, `default` is reinitialized as a new list each time because it's an immutable type (`None`), so no values persist between function calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In Summary:\n",

    "A **partial function** in Python is created using the `functools.partial` function. It allows you to \"freeze\" some portion of a function's arguments or keywords, resulting in a new function with fewer arguments to specify.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a breakdown of the concept and the example:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Partial Function?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: It creates a new function by fixing some arguments of the original function. The resulting function can be called with the remaining arguments.\n",
    "- **Usage**: It simplifies function calls where some arguments are frequently the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `functools.partial` function takes a callable (function, method, or other callable object) as its first argument, followed by positional and keyword arguments that you want to \"pre-fill.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Original Function**:  \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   lambda x, y: x * y\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This is an anonymous function (lambda) that multiplies two numbers, `x` and `y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Partial Function**:  \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   multiply_by_2 = partial(lambda x, y: x * y, 2)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - `partial` fixes the first argument `x` of the lambda function to `2`. \n",
    "   - The resulting `multiply_by_2` function effectively becomes:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     lambda y: 2 * y\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Usage of the Partial Function**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(multiply_by_2(3))  # 6\n",
    "   print(multiply_by_2(5))  # 10\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - When you call `multiply_by_2(3)`, it computes `2 * 3` and returns `6`.\n",
    "   - Similarly, `multiply_by_2(5)` computes `2 * 5` and returns `10`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits of Using Partial Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reusability**: You can reuse a partially fixed function with different remaining arguments.\n",
    "- **Simplified Code**: Avoids repeated specification of common arguments.\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Useful in functional programming paradigms.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you often multiply numbers by `2`, defining `multiply_by_2` using `partial` simplifies your task."

    "Both **partial functions** and **default arguments** simplify function calls, but they differ in their use cases, flexibility, and functionality. Here's a detailed comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Default Arguments**\n",
    "Default arguments are defined within the function signature. They provide fallback values if no argument is passed during the function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(x, y=10):\n",
    "    return x + y\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",

    "print(add(5, 20))  # 25 (overrides default y=10)\n",

    "**Advantages of Default Arguments**:\n",
    "1. **Simple to use**: Built directly into the function signature, easy to read and understand.\n",

    "3. **Less overhead**: No need for external tools like `functools.partial`.\n",

    "- **Limited to one function**: Default arguments are specific to the function where they are defined.\n",
    "- **Not reusable**: If you need the same \"pre-filled\" behavior for other functions or use cases, you'll need to duplicate code or logic.\n",
    "- **Cannot fix intermediate arguments**: Default arguments only work from the end of the argument list backward (e.g., you can fix `y` but not `x` without rearranging the arguments).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Partial Functions**\n",
    "Partial functions, created using `functools.partial`, allow you to fix some arguments of an existing function, creating a new callable with a subset of arguments.\n",

    "# Usage\n",
    "print(add_five(10))  # 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of Partial Functions**:\n",
    "1. **Reusable across functions**: You can create multiple specialized versions of the same or different functions dynamically.\n",
    "2. **Flexibility**: You can fix arguments in the middle or beginning of the parameter list without changing the original function's definition.\n",
    "3. **Dynamic behavior**: Partial functions can be created at runtime, offering more flexibility in how arguments are set.\n",
    "4. **Works with any callable**: Partial works with functions, methods, lambdas, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations**:\n",
    "- **Requires `functools`**: Adds some overhead by requiring an additional module and a slightly more complex syntax.\n",

    "### **Example Combining Both**\n",
    "\n",

    "def calculate_price(price, tax_rate=0.05, discount=0):\n",
    "    return price * (1 + tax_rate) - discount\n",

    "print(calculate_price(100, tax_rate=0.1))  # Custom tax rate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Partial Function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from functools import partial\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fix tax_rate for a specific region\n",
    "regional_calculator = partial(calculate_price, tax_rate=0.08)\n",

    "print(regional_calculator(100))         # Tax rate fixed at 0.08\n",
    "print(promotional_calculator(100, tax_rate=0.1))  # Discount fixed at 20, custom tax\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why partial?**:\n",
    "- Partial allows fixing intermediate arguments like `tax_rate` or `discount` without modifying the original function or adding redundant default arguments. It also creates reusable variants dynamically."

    "A **context manager** in Python is an object that defines methods for setting up and cleaning up a resource, typically used with the `with` statement. It ensures that resources are properly acquired and released, even if an exception occurs. The primary use of a context manager is for handling resources like file operations, database connections, or network connections, ensuring that they are properly opened and closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the most common way to create a context manager is by using the `with` statement. When used with files, it ensures that the file is properly closed after the block of code inside the `with` statement completes, even if an error occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where is the context manager used in your example?\n",

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- `open(filename, 'w')` is a context manager.\n",
    "  - `open` is a built-in function that opens a file and returns a file object.\n",
    "  - By using it with the `with` statement, Python automatically handles opening the file and ensures that it is closed after the block of code inside the `with` statement is executed, even if an error occurs within that block.\n",
    "- The `as f` part assigns the file object to the variable `f`, which can then be used inside the block to write to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the **core idea** of a context manager: it ensures resources are properly cleaned up (in this case, closing the file) once the code finishes executing, without the programmer needing to explicitly call `f.close()`.\n",
