    "  - If false: It decreases the current value (`self.current -= 1`) and returns it.\n",

    "This code implements the **singleton pattern**, ensuring that only one instance of the `DatabaseConnection` class is ever created. All calls to create a new instance of the class (`db1`, `db2`, etc.) return the same existing instance. Let’s break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Code Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`singleton` Decorator**:\n",
    "   - It takes a class (`cls`) as input and returns a modified version of the class wrapped in `wrapper_func`.\n",
    "   - **Inside `wrapper_func`**:\n",
    "     - It uses a dictionary, `instances`, to store the created instance of the class (`cls`).\n",
    "     - If `cls` is **not** already in `instances`, it creates a new instance and stores it:\n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       instances[cls] = cls(*args, **kwargs)\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "     - If `cls` **is already in `instances`**, it simply returns the existing instance:\n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       return instances[cls]\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Decorating the Class**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   @singleton\n",
    "   class DatabaseConnection:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This applies the `singleton` decorator to `DatabaseConnection`.\n",
    "   - After decoration, `DatabaseConnection` is replaced by `wrapper_func`.  \n",
    "     So, **calling `DatabaseConnection()` is equivalent to calling `wrapper_func`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Creating Instances**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   db1 = DatabaseConnection()\n",
    "   db2 = DatabaseConnection()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - `db1` and `db2` both call `wrapper_func`.\n",
    "   - On the first call (`db1`):\n",
    "     - `cls` is not in `instances`, so it creates a new instance (`cls(*args, **kwargs)`) and stores it in `instances`.\n",
    "   - On the second call (`db2`):\n",
    "     - `cls` **is already in `instances`**, so it returns the same instance created earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Checking Equality**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(db1 == db2)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Since both `db1` and `db2` refer to the same object (the same instance), the equality check is `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why `db1` and `db2` Are Equal**\n",
    "- **Singleton ensures only one instance exists**:\n",
    "  - The `instances` dictionary ensures that once a class instance is created, it is reused for subsequent calls.\n",
    "  - So, both `db1` and `db2` point to the **same object in memory**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why All Function Calls Work on the Same Singleton**\n",
    "- The `instances` dictionary **stores and reuses the same instance** of the class.  \n",
    "- Whenever you call `DatabaseConnection()`, the decorator checks if an instance already exists:\n",
    "  - If yes, it **returns the same instance**.\n",
    "  - This ensures that all calls to `DatabaseConnection()` work with the same object.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Behavior of Singleton**\n",
    "1. **Single Instance**: Only one instance of the class is created.\n",
    "2. **Shared State**: All calls (`db1`, `db2`, etc.) use the same object.\n",
    "3. **Efficiency**: Saves resources by avoiding repeated instantiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your example, the **single instance** created on the first call is reused for all subsequent calls. That's why `db1` and `db2` are equal."

    "Great question! The reason `instances = {}` is not re-executed every time the `singleton` decorator is applied is tied to **how Python functions and closures work**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why `instances = {}` Is Not Reset**\n",
    "1. **`singleton` Is Executed Only Once for Each Decorated Class**:\n",
    "   - When you write `@singleton` on a class, the `singleton` function is executed only **once** at the time the class is decorated.\n",
    "   - This happens during program initialization or when the module is imported.\n",
    "   - At this point, the `instances` dictionary is created and **persists** within the closure of the `wrapper_func`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   For example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   @singleton\n",
    "   class DatabaseConnection:\n",
    "       ...\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Here, `singleton(DatabaseConnection)` runs once, and it returns the `wrapper_func` with `instances` in its closure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Persistent `instances` Due to Closure**:\n",
    "   - The `instances` dictionary is a variable defined in the outer scope (`singleton` function) of the `wrapper_func`.\n",
    "   - Because of closures, `instances` persists and retains its value as long as `wrapper_func` is used.\n",
    "   - It is **not re-initialized** on subsequent calls to `wrapper_func`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Key point**: The `singleton` function doesn't execute again unless you explicitly reapply it, so `instances = {}` isn't reset.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What Happens When the Decorated Class Is Called**\n",
    "When you call the decorated class, like `db1 = DatabaseConnection()`, you're actually calling the `wrapper_func`. This does **not** re-trigger the `singleton` function itself; instead, it only executes the logic inside `wrapper_func`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Visualization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the lifecycle step-by-step:\n",
    "1. **Decorator Application**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   @singleton\n",
    "   class DatabaseConnection:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - `singleton` is executed once.\n",
    "   - `instances = {}` is created and stored in the closure of `wrapper_func`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **First Call**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   db1 = DatabaseConnection()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - `wrapper_func` is called.\n",
    "   - It checks `if cls not in instances` and creates a new instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Second Call**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   db2 = DatabaseConnection()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - `wrapper_func` is called again.\n",
    "   - `instances` is **still available in the closure**, so the same instance is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaway**\n",
    "The `instances` dictionary is initialized **once** when `singleton` runs during decoration. It persists because of closures and is shared across all calls to the decorated class. It is not re-executed because the `singleton` function itself is not called again."

    "### **Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`uppercase` Decorator**:\n",
    "   - The `uppercase` decorator takes the class `cls` (in this case, `ReverseString`) as input and defines a new class `Wrapped` that inherits from `cls`.\n",
    "   - The new `Wrapped` class overrides the `__init__` method:\n",
    "     - It calls the base class's `__init__` method via `super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)` to initialize the attributes.\n",
    "     - It then modifies `self.string` to be the uppercase version of the string (`self.string = self.string.upper()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Class Replacement**:\n",
    "   - The `@uppercase` decorator effectively replaces `ReverseString` with the `Wrapped` class.\n",
    "   - Since `Wrapped` inherits from `ReverseString`, it still retains the `__iter__` and `__next__` methods from the original `ReverseString`.\n",
    "   - Therefore, `ReverseString` is now the `Wrapped` class, and the new class has all the original functionality of `ReverseString` along with the additional uppercase modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iteration**:\n",
    "   - When you create an instance of `ReverseString(\"hello\")`, it actually creates an instance of the `Wrapped` class, which has the `string` attribute set to `\"HELLO\"`.\n",
    "   - The iteration (`for char in ReverseString(\"hello\")`) works because the `__iter__` and `__next__` methods are still available in the `Wrapped` class (inherited from `ReverseString`).\n",
    "   - The string is iterated in reverse order, and since it's been converted to uppercase, the output will be `'O', 'L', 'L', 'E', 'H'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Verification of Comments**\n",
    "\n",
    "The comments are **correct**:\n",
    "- `ReverseString` is now equivalent to the `Wrapped` class due to the decorator.\n",
    "- The `Wrapped` class inherits from `ReverseString`, so it retains all methods, including `__iter__` and `__next__`, which are part of the original `ReverseString`.\n",
    "- The `string` is modified to uppercase within the `__init__` of `Wrapped`, but the iteration functionality is inherited from `ReverseString`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Final Output**\n",
    "If you run the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for char in ReverseString(\"hello\"):\n",
    "    print(char)\n",
