    "The `split()` method in Python, when used without any arguments, will split a string at **any whitespace** characters, including spaces, newlines (`\\n`), and tabs (`\\t`). It treats all types of whitespace as delimiters, so it works for not just spaces, but also other whitespace characters such as newlines and tabs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How `split()` works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- By default, `split()` splits the string at any sequence of whitespace characters (spaces, newlines, tabs, etc.) and returns a list of words.\n",
    "- It also **ignores extra whitespace**. For example, if there are multiple spaces, tabs, or newlines between words, it will treat them as a single delimiter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "text = \"Hello \\n world\\t this is   a test\"\n",
    "words = text.split()\n",
    "print(words)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "['Hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'a', 'test']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the above example:\n",
    "  - The `\\n` (newline) and `\\t` (tab) are treated as spaces, and multiple spaces between words are ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In your code:\n",
    "When you use `split()` in the `count_words()` function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def count_words(filename):\n",
    "    with open(filename, 'r') as file:\n",
    "        text = file.read()\n",
    "        words = text.split()\n",
    "        return len(words)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It will split the text at all types of whitespace characters, including spaces, newlines, and tabs, and count the number of resulting words.\n",

    "\n",
    "So, for consecutive `\\n` or `\\t`, it **removes all of them** and splits only where there are actual words.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- The `split()` method treats **all whitespace characters** (spaces, newlines, and tabs) as the same and removes any excess ones.\n",
    "- Even though you have multiple newlines (`\\n`) and tabs (`\\t`) in between words, `split()` treats them as a single delimiter and ignores the extra ones.\n",
    "- The result is a list of words that were separated by any form of whitespace, regardless of how many consecutive newlines or tabs there were.\n",

    "1. **Without `newline=''`**: \n",
