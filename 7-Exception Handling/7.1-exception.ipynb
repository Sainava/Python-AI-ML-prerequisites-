    "Yes, in your code, `e` is an object, specifically an instance of the exception class (in this case, a `ZeroDivisionError` object).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you catch an exception using `except Exception as e`, `e` holds the exception instance. This instance is an object that contains information about the error that occurred. The type of this object is the class of the exception, such as `ZeroDivisionError` for division by zero errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a breakdown of what happens:\n",
    "1. The `try` block tries to execute `1/0`, which raises a `ZeroDivisionError` because division by zero is not allowed.\n",
    "2. The `except` block catches this error and binds the exception instance to the variable `e`.\n",
    "3. `e` is an instance of the `ZeroDivisionError` class, and you can print its message or access other attributes that the exception provides.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when you run the code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",

    "#### 1. **`if 'file' in locals()`**\n",
    "This checks whether the variable `file` has been defined in the current local scope. In the event of an error (like `FileNotFoundError`), the `file` variable may not be created, so this condition ensures that the code does not raise a `NameError` when trying to access `file`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **`not file.closed()`**\n",
    "This checks whether the file object `file` is still open. The `.closed` attribute of a file object returns `True` if the file is closed, so `not file.closed()` will evaluate to `True` if the file is still open.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combining These Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Case 1: `if 'file' in locals() or not file.closed():`**\n",
    "- The **`or`** operator ensures that the `finally` block runs the `file.close()` statement if either of the following is true:\n",
    "  - The `file` variable exists in the local scope (`'file' in locals()`).\n",
    "  - The file object is not closed (`not file.closed()`).\n",
    "  \n",
    "This combination is problematic because:\n",
    "- If `file` is defined but is already closed, `file.close()` will still run unnecessarily.\n",
    "- If `file` doesn't exist but another condition somehow evaluates to `True`, a `NameError` will occur when trying to access `file`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Case 2: `if 'file' in locals() and not file.closed():`**\n",
    "- The **`and`** operator ensures that the `file.close()` statement is executed only if both of the following are true:\n",
    "  - The `file` variable exists in the local scope (`'file' in locals()`).\n",
    "  - The file object is still open (`not file.closed()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination is safer because:\n",
    "- It first checks if `file` exists.\n",
    "- It only attempts to close the file if it is still open.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why the Second Case (`and`) is Better\n",
    "The second condition ensures:\n",
    "1. There is no attempt to close a file that doesn't exist (avoids `NameError`).\n",
    "2. If the file is already closed, `file.close()` is not called unnecessarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fixed Code for `finally` Block\n",
    "```python\n",

    "    if 'file' in locals() and not file.closed():\n",
    "        file.close()\n",
    "        print('file closed')\n",
